## Tips for scanning the code

Google Authenticator blocks screenshots so you cannot copy the code and scan it on the same device directly.
Here are a couple of methods for getting the code scanned:

- Use another device (B) to take a picture of the code on the screen of device A. Scan the picture you just took from the screen of device B with Authenticator Pro on device A.
- Bypass the screenshot block, here is a guide that may help: [How to take a screenshot in Android when an app doesn't want you to](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/11/how-to-take-a-screenshot-in-android-when-an-app-doesnt-want-you-to/)
