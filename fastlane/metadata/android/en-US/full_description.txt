Authenticator Pro generates Two Factor Authentication (2FA) codes for your online accounts. Both TOTP and HOTP are supported. The generated codes are one time tokens that provide an extra layer of security to your online accounts. After scanning a simple QR code, your account is protected.

<b>Compatibility</b>
Authenticator Pro is compatible with most providers and accounts. View some supported providers here: https://twofactorauth.org/ (marked with "software token").

<b>Backup / Restore</b>
Backup your authenticators with strong encryption. In case you lose your or change phone, you can always gain access to your accounts. Save to cloud storage or to your device.

<b>Dark Mode</b>
Authenticator Pro has a beautiful material design inspired look in either light or dark themes.

<b>Icons</b>
Find your authenticators easily with recognisable brand logos and icons next to each code.

<b>Categories</b>
Organise your authenticators into categories.

<b>Offline with few permissions</b>
Authenticator Pro only requires a single permission and does not require Internet access to function.

<b>Customisation</b>
Set icons and rename. You can also arrange your authenticators in any order you like so you can find them easily.

<b>Open-Source</b>
The application source code can be viewed by everyone on GitHub.

Authenticator Pro is also available as a Wear OS companion app. Quickly view your authenticators directly from your watch. Please note that a connection to your Android device is required.

2 Factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring the use of a one time code to log in. In addition to your username and password, you will need a code provided by Authenticator Pro. So even if your login details are compromised, your account remains safe.
