A free open-source two factor authentication app for Android. It features encrypted backups, icons, categories and a high level of customisation. It also has a Wear OS companion app.

It supports TOTP (Time Based) and HOTP (Counter Based) authenticators using either SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512 hashing algorithms. Mobile-Otp (mOTP), Steam and Yandex are also supported.

2 Factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring the use of a one time code to log in.
In addition to your username and password, you will need a code provided by Authenticator Pro. So even if your login details are compromised, your account remains safe.
